September and October experience relatively lower revenue, highlighting opportunities for targeted promotions.

🔹 Category Performance

Classic pizzas contribute the highest share of total sales and orders, making them the most popular category.

Supreme and Veggie pizzas also perform well, reflecting diverse customer preferences.

Maintaining variety while strengthening Classic offerings can maximize overall revenue.

Large-size pizzas generate the highest percentage of total revenue, followed by Medium sizes.

XL and XXL pizzas contribute minimally, indicating limited customer demand.

Upselling strategies should primarily focus on Large and Medium pizzas.

🔹 Best-Selling Pizzas

Thai Chicken Pizza is the top revenue-generating pizza.

These pizzas are ideal candidates for promotions and combo deals.
